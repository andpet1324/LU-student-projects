# LU-student-projects
Repo for dumping code as it was at the time a project ended, along with notes on setup and dependencies 

Please **make a suitably named new directory for your project**, and add a README specific to your project where you detail:
- software dependencies/version (e.g. what container did you init with denv)
- any requirements on directory structures or other setup steps
- explicit step-by-step instructions on how to run your code
- anything else that is useful for the next person to know
- and a pointer to your thesis!

Bonus points for hints on where to go next (e.g. from your outlook) with this code.
